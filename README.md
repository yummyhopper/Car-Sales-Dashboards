# KPI Dashboards for Car Sales Data
For this project I created KPI Dashboards in IBM Cognos Analytics and Microsoft Excel to evaluate key metrics such as sales, service, and profit data. I used several types of analysis and visualization techniques and created a clean and succinct final product.
- Cognos_Dashboards gives a link for an IBM Cognos Analytics dashboard I created to reveal key sales and service insights
- CarSalesByModel.xlsx is an Excel spreadsheet created for the purpose of displaying key sales and profit metrics
